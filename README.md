# Analog_IC_Design_IN_Xschem
I've uploaded diverse design, script, and report files that illustrate Xschem installation and usage. Topics include MOSFET operating points, internal parameter display, AC/transient analysis, NMOS/PMOS characterization, and a 2-stage OTA design for unity feedback. More content coming soon.
